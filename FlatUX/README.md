FlatUX Theme for RetroArch & Lakka
====================

About FlatUX
-----------------

The original motivation was to complete the FlatUI icons by coloring those in the monochrome set, it ended up becoming much more. While it has existed as the "Retroactive" theme for years, the time has come to merge FlatUI and Retroactive, thus creating FlatUX.

Guidelines
----------

### Palette

 * Icons use the 40 color expanded FlatUX palette found in the devtools color palette folder. 
 * The use of dark blue and gray colors is encouraged as a baseline.  Once the icon looks great in those colors, feel free to add color in order to make the icon as recognizable as possible.
 * Use of gradients and translucency is prohibited in favor of maintaining a flat look.

### Layout

 * The design should be easily recognizable.
 * The icons should be set to a 256x256 canvas and should be centered on a 64x64 grid. Snap design elements to the grid wherever possible to provide maximum clarity and scalability.
 * Icon must have a 16px margin, effectively reducing the icon size to 232x232.
 
### Style

 * The level of detail is expanded beyond the scope of the monochrome set, but favors flat design and recognizability over absolute realism.

### Export
The SVG and PNG files can be created using the ImageMagick Mogrify command and Kivutar’s convert.sh script.
